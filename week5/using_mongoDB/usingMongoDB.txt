Create a Database Called "my_first_db":
    use my_first_db

Create a student collection:
    db.createCollection("students")

Create 5 students with the appropriate info:
    db.students.insert({name: "Scott Scroggs", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 15, birthday: {month: 05, day: 25, year: 1995}})
    db.students.insert({name: "Emerick Jones", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 07, day: 04, year: 1980}})
    db.students.insert({name: "Ice Cube", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 4, birthday: {month: 03, day: 23, year: 1972}})
    db.students.insert({name: "John Wick", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 9, birthday: {month: 09, day: 29, year: 1965}})
    db.students.insert({name: "Jah Vascript", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 1, birthday: {month: 01, day: 21, year: 1990}})

Get students:
    db.students.find()

Retrieve all students who are from California or Washington:
    db.students.find({home_state: "California"})
    db.students.find({home_state: "Washington"})

Retrieve all students whose lucky number is greater than 3:
    db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})


Retrieve all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10:
    db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})


Retrieve all students whose lucky number is between  1 and 9 (inclusive)
    db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 9, $gte:1}})


Add a field named 'interests' to all student documents in the collection.
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {interests: ['coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB']}})


Add some unique interests for each particular student into their interest arrays.
    db.students.update({name: "Scott Scroggs"}, {$push: {interests: 'cryptocurrency'}})
    db.students.update({name: "Emerick Jones"}, {$push: {interests:'freedom'}})
    db.students.update({name: "Ice Cube"}, {$push: {interests:'hip-hop'}})
    db.students.update({name: "John Wick"}, {$push: {interests:'firearms'}})
    db.students.update({name: "Jah Vascript"}, {$push: {interests:'browsers'}})


Add the interest 'taxes' to someone's interest array.
    db.students.update({name: "Scott Scroggs"}, {$push: {interests: 'taxes'}})

Remove the 'taxes' interest that was added
    db.students.update({name: "Scott Scroggs"}, {$pull: {interests: 'taxes'}})
    db.students.update({name: "Scott Scroggs"}, {$push: {interests: 'not paying taxes'}})

Remove all students who are from California (good)
    db.students.remove({home_state: "California"})

Remove a student by name
    db.students.remove({name: "Jah Vascript"})

Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
    db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}}, true)

Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})

Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington.
    db.students.updateMany({home_state: "Washington"}, {$inc: {number_of_belts: 1}})

Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$rename: {'number_of_belts': 'belts_earned'}})

Remove the 'lucky_number' field
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$unset: {'lucky_number': ''}})

Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {'updated_on': Date()}})
